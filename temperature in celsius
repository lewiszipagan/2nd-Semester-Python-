#1. Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. The program should print a message based on the temperature: 
#If the temperature is less than -273.15, print that the temperature is invalid because it is below absolute zero. 
#If it is exactly -273.15, print that the temperature is absolute 0. 
#If the temperature is between -273.15 and 0, print that the temperature is below freezing. 
#If it is 0, print that the temperature is at the freezing point. 
#If it is between 0 and 100, print that the temperature is in the normal range. 
#If it is 100, print that the temperature is at the boiling point. 
#If it is above 100, print that the temperature is above the boiling point.
