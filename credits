#2. Write a program that asks the user how many credits they have taken. If they have taken 23 or less, print that the student is a freshman. If they have taken between 24 and 53, print that they are a sophomore. The range for juniors is 54 to 83, and for seniors it is 84 and over.

print("Good Day Client")
credit = eval(input("how many credits you have taken: "))
if credit <=23:
    print("you are student freshman")
elif credit >=24 and credit <=53:
    print("you are a sophomore")
elif credit >=53 and credit <=83:
    print("you are juniors ")  
else:
    print("you are seniors")
